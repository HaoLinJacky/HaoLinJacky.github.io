Hello! My name is Hao Lin. I am currently a **Ph.D student** in Electrical and Computer Engineering at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), in the Communication Theory Lab (CTL), under supervision of [Prof. Mohamed-Slim Alouini](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/profiles/mohamed-slim-alouini). 
I obtained the **M.Sc. degree** in Electrical and Computer Engineering from King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Dec. 2024 and the **B.Eng. degree** in Communication Engineering from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in Jun. 2023.
My research interests include: wireless communications, non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), Internet of Things (IoT), stochastic geometry, global connectivity, network-level performance analysis, etc. 
Our team aims to connect the unconnected areas (rural, remote and hard-to-reach areas) through space-air-ground integrated systems (SAGIN), radio frequency (RF) and free-space optic (FSO) techniques.
